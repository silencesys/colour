        Colors can do much more than we can even imagine. With colors, you can express your feelings, set a mood or just use them as a starting point for your creations. The goal of Colorizer is to make our everyday life colorful. Thanks to a simple color generator, there's a new color waiting for you each time you visit the website. But you can also generate new random colors using the button next to the color code at the bottom of the page, or enter your own color code and see how the color looks like. Colorizer supports two color code formats - RGB (e.g.: 255,0,255) and HEX (e.g. ff00ff or ccc).
